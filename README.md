## Description
This project is designed to introduce to the fundamentals of using a low-level graphic library in C. The main objective is to create visual representations of fractals, focusing on the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set as the mandatory components. I learned how to manage pixels, handle complex mathematical calculations, and render intricate fractal patterns. The project serves as a hands-on approach to understanding graphic algorithms and exploring the fascinating world of fractals.

## Installation

1. **Clone the git :**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kernicterus/fract-ol_42.git
   ```

2. **Clone the git of the minilibx at the root of the repo:**
   ```bash
   cd fract-ol_42 && git clone https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux.git
   ```

3. **Make :**
   ```bash
   make bonus
   ```

## Usage

4. **Run the program :**
   ```bash
   ./fractol
   ```
